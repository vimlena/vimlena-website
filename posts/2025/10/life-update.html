            <p>
                Hey, it&rsquo;s been a minute since I updated this site so I thought I would do a
                life update type post and just talk about I&rsquo;ve been up to
            </p>
            <h2 id="jobschool-update">Job/School Update</h2>
            <p>
                Mid-August, I was unexpectedly laid off of my job because of AI automating my role
                and the company downsizing the department I worked in because of this. It&rsquo;s a
                scary time to be unemployed as a queer trans person with the state of everything as
                of late, feels like a lot of companies out there view trans people as sort of a
                liability or &ldquo;issue.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever known so many
                people who are unemployed at one time since I have entered the labor force as there
                are now. This also occurred just as I was about to start attending college again. I
                very briefly went to college about a decade ago but dropped out before getting any
                sort of degree. Part of my decision to return to school was feeling secure enough at
                my (now previous) job that I could juggle it and school at the same time. This is a
                prospect I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to at all, but I was willing to navigate if
                my job was at least predictable. As it turns out, not everything happens as you
                predict.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a period of time I got very depressed after being laid off. I debated not going
                to school this year because of not having a very solid foundation to start the year
                on, but at this point I had already picked my classes so I elected to just go
                anyway. Maybe I could use this time where I don&rsquo;t have to deal with work to
                give me some time to remember how to do things like studying or managing my time
                while doing assignments and projects. I looked for a job on the side but mostly
                focused on school for the time being, and eventually I was able to snag some various
                interviews. It feels like being unemployed is a full time job, ironically enough.
                Anyway, eventually I got a position at a local non-profit doing actually really
                great work and offering me very reasonable benefits, pay, and hours. The
                unemployment horror was coming to an end and I could finally allow myself to breathe
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                School has been somewhat challenging to get back into and I have changed the program
                I&rsquo;m part of since starting in the early fall. Initially I wanted to be a nurse
                but I eventually realized that the nursing program was not compatible with me
                working full-time during regular hours so I had to pivot to something more
                compatible with my schedule. Eventually I decided on a Computer Science and IT type
                program mostly focused on Networking technologies that would lead me to eventually
                have a position like Network Admin or something along those lines. My thought with
                selecting this program is that a lot of technology stuff is going to be replaced by
                AI, but that AI cannot do things like physically setting up a network or firewall.
                Also as everything increasingly becomes more and more focused on the internet and
                more people are connected to each other than ever before, making sure networks are
                configured correctly, secure, and running well would be important. I have been a
                computer nerd for as long as I have been around computers and it just seems like a
                logical progression to move towards doing computer stuff as a job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, all of that said, I haven&rsquo;t been updating my website because
                I&rsquo;ve been unable to stop moving forward or I would drown (like a shark)
                lately. Between starting a new job and starting school, while navigating having no
                insurance, being in a band, having friendships and relationships, etc. I have
                literally never been so busy as I am now.

            <p>
                Despite not posting anything new on here, I have been working on and off on the
                site. I updated the default color scheme to be derived from the really lovely and
                functional <a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a> color schemes,
                specifically their light theme
                <a href="https://catppuccin.com/palette/#flavor-latte">Latte</a> for the default
                light mode view and their medium-dark theme
                <a href="https://catppuccin.com/palette/#flavor-macchiato">Macchiato</a> for the
                dark mode view.
            </p>
            <p>
                I changed the default typefaces as well. Currently I am using
                <a href="https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat">Montserrat</a> for headings and
                <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter">Inter</a> for body text. I&rsquo;m currently
                using <a href="https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font">Meslo LG</a> for monospaced
                text, although this will change soon, which brings me to my next update.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lenamono">LenaMono</h2>
            <p>
                I had talked about the monospace typeface
                <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a> in my
                <a href="https://vimlena.com/posts/2025/08/good-free-fonts">last typography post</a
                >. I got around to looking at some of the various customization options for
                generating variants of Iosevka, and quickly had a realization that it was just as
                much a monospaced typeface development framework as it was a typeface. The About
                section on its GitHub repo being “Versatile typeface for code, from code” clicked
                and I decided to try my hand at generating my own customized version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several different revisions later and a fair amount of trial and error, I am
                announcing my own distribution of Iosevka called LenaMono. The biggest inspiration
                for the glyph choices I made come from
                <a href="https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font">Meslo LG</a>, as it and
                <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/">DejaVu Sans Mono</a> have long been my
                personal favorite monospaced typefaces for programming. I was also informed by
                <a href="https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC">Inconsolata LGC</a> as well as
                <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a>, both
                are personal favorites of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have gathered that programming ligatures are a bit of a controversial subject
                among programmers; I think they&rsquo;re visually nice, but also respect those who
                prefer to have their code represented literally. With this in mind, I created
                <code>L</code> (ligatures) and <code>NL</code> (no ligatures) versions of the
                typeface so that I wasn&rsquo;t forcing my preference there on anybody. I also opted
                to include three different widths to allow for saving horizontal space if preferred
                or required: a regular width, a <code>SC</code> (semi-condensed) width, and a
                <code>C</code> (condensed) width. This all means that LenaMono actually has 6
                variations represented by the letters appended to the <code>LenaMono</code> name.
                For example, if you wanted to use LenaMono with no ligatures and a semi-condensed
                width, you would list the name in your editor as <code>LenaMonoNLSC</code> (No
                Ligatures, Semi-Condensed). If you wanted a regular version with ligatures, you
                would use <code>LenaMonoL</code> (Ligatures). If you wanted to use the condensed
                version with ligatures, you would use <code>LenaMonoLC</code>. I opted for
                generating the font files in discrete widths and with ligatures on or off so that
                people could easily select the version they preferred or worked for what they were
                doing. I know that most software nowadays lets you pick a variant from a dropdown
                menu or an attribute in a configuration file, but, to me, this just seemed like an
                easier approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the <code>private-build-plans.toml</code> files for the variants are included in
                their respective folders which you can use to generate your own variants of Iosevka
                if you copy it to the downloaded/copied Iosevka repo and run a command in it. For
                the details of that, check out the
                <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer">Iosevka Customizer</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also patched each variant with Nerd Font symbols, they&rsquo;re included in
                the
                <code>NerdFonts</code> folder inside of each variant. To use the Nerd Font version
                of LenaMono, select the name of the variant you want and type
                <code>Nerd Font</code> after it (like <code>LenaMonoNLSC Nerd Font</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
                I&rsquo;m going to make a separate post when I release LenaMono publicly so keep an
                eye out for that.

            <h2 id="celebrity-dui-website">Celebrity DUI Website</h2>
            <p>
                I made a website for my band Celebrity DUI, you can view it at
                <a href="https://celebrityduis.com/">celebrityduis.com</a>. We went for more of a
                Geocities early internet aesthetic for this, and it is still a work in progress, but
                I&rsquo;m proud of how it looks so far. It was actually somewhat difficult for me to
                design something that looks a bit rough around the edges as I generally try to make
                everything look, well, good. I literally had to go on old Geocities archives to get
                an idea what a website like this would look like under the hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I plan to add some more pages and Easter eggs to the site to make it more
                fun to look through. We talked about adding some various behind-the-scenes and rough
                recordings of songs just because we all like it when bands we like include special
                features like that. I was also able to find a lot of really good old GIFs via the
                Internet Archive search engine
                <a href="https://gifcities.org/">gifcities.org</a> that I want to use on the
                website, currently they&rsquo;re all just like stored in the images directory for
                future use.
            </p>
            <h2 id="helix-editor-zed">Helix Editor and Zed</h2>
            <p>
                After being a long-time Vim (and NeoVim) user, I have migrated over to using the
                <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix Editor</a>. I was initially unsure about
                it as many of the bindings for navigating and editing text were similar to
                Vim/NeoVim but slightly different in a way that was a bit difficult to wrap my head
                around. As I actually used it for a longer period of time, however, I realized that
                they were actually really good and made sense as a design choice. Helix is free and
                open source, written in Rust, and runs in the terminal. Rather than relying on
                plugins for many things expected of a modern editor, Helix takes a “batteries
                included” approach and allows for you to configure your settings in a simple
                <code>toml</code> file for anything that doesn&rsquo;t just work out of the box.
                There are a lot of really well-designed quality of life improvements compared to
                NeoVim and Helix is quickly becoming one of my essential programs as I use it for
                more and more stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still sometimes use a GUI editor for just quick edits or looking at files when
                I&rsquo;m not in the terminal, for this I have started to use
                <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> instead of my old go-to Sublime Text. I
                appreciate how fast and easy to configure Zed is, it even has a fairly comprehensive
                Helix mode built-in. Zed seems to push AI coding, which I am not personally a fan or
                and don&rsquo;t use, but thankfully you can turn this all off in the settings with a
                simple <code>"disable_ai": true</code> in the config file. Zed, like Helix, is free,
                open source, and made with Rust.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have coincidentally been looking into learning Rust with the intention of using it
                as I move into more network-oriented computer projects because of its security and
                excellent speed. Rust seems really powerful, but getting the hang of it seems like a
                bit of a daunting task. I am slowly working my way up to that by just reading more
                about it and exposing myself to the syntax and approaches to problem solving it
                utilizes. Pretty crazy how Mozilla dissolved the Rust development branch just the
                language started to take off also, kinda fumbled the ball there.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                I&rsquo;m going to try and post more frequently in the coming days because I do
                really like having my own little corner of the internet to just ramble about
                whatever I want. With my new job, I am actually writing a lot which is great because
                hopefully it means that I will improve as time passes, so posting here is a good
                habit I want to get back into when I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&rsquo;m working on a follow-up to my
