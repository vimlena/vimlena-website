            <h2>Against the Closed and Convenient Web</h2>
            <p>
                It’s probably never been easier than it is now to post (for better or worse).
                Between conventional social media, microblogging, long-form writing sites and blogs,
                Forum-adjacent sites, and platforms that obscure the difference between social media
                and messaging, you have a wide variety of formats and options available. There’s
                also been increase in non-technical website creation services the past decade that
                allow users to drag and drop sections onto a page or choose from customizable
                templates, no coding expertise required. This is all a pretty remarkable change of
                pace from how the internet was in the days of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), Internet
                Relay Chat (IRC), and Web 1.0 sites. It would seem almost backwards to make a
                read-only independent website considering how utilizing already-existing is
                generally pretty easy and free or cheap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cory Doctorow, prolific sci-fi author, journalist, blogger, and general internet
                guy, coined a term to talk about platforms and their tendency to plateau and die out
                over time
                <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys"
                    >called “enshittification”</a
                >. When a new platform starts out, it offers features to attract and become valuable
                or useful to new consumers/users as well as sellers/creators. Things are pretty good
                initially but the platform inevitably enters a 3 way tug-of-war between the
                priorities of shareholders, sellers/creators, and consumers/users. The shareholders
                eventually win and the platform turns against the sellers/creators and
                consumers/users. Despite the platform no longer serving anybody but the
                shareholders, people continue to utilize it because it is established and the cost
                of leaving outweighs the cost of staying. People may either begin to leave for a
                different platform that has sprung up also offering attractive/valuable features and
                the cycle repeats, or it becomes impossible to avoid and everybody utilizes it at
                least sometimes for lack of better options (Facebook is an example of the former and
                Amazon and Google is are examples of the latter). This all happens because, at the
                end of the day, internet platforms are owned and run by businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another downside to many internet platforms is how closed off or exclusive they are,
                an environment known as a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">“walled garden.”</a>
                The businesses that run internet platforms want to keep you within their app or
                website as much as possible because that’s how they can make the most money or
                gather the most valuable information from you. In example, think of how clicking a
                link while using a mobile app opens an in-app browser so that you can easily go back
                to scrolling once you finish reading, the way you can’t download software on an
                iPhone anywhere but the App Store (without modifying the device), You don’t have to
                create an account to view my website, you don’t have to pay for a membership or a
                fee to get in, it’s entirely open.
            </p>
            <p>
                In regard to website creation service, there’s some level of sacrificing options for
                convenience that I am not a fan of. While something like Squarespace may be useful
                for somebody who’s not technically inclined, and it’s probably good that something
                like that exists, I enjoy having the flexibility of being able to tweak everything
                just how I like it. Also, the code those services generate is hideous.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah, I wanted to make a website that would be my own that anybody could access.
                It isn’t dependent on a platform, doesn’t bug people to make an account or get a
                membership, and it’s easy to maintain. If, for some reason, this domain dies or
                something happens to a service I use then I have all the underlying code on my
                computer and can simply re-upload it somewhere else without issue.
            </p>
            <h2>Design and Coding</h2>
            <p>
                I didn’t have an extremely solid idea exactly what I wanted to do with this website
                before I started making it. I have always been sort of a computer nerd and would do
                things like bringing my laptop to school with me so that I could make little silly
                programs and tweak my Linux install rather than doing schoolwork. Before I had a
                computer to myself and access to the internet, I would spend hours adjusting
                different settings on my family’s Windows 95 (and later XP) install. Messing around
                with a technology and seeing what happens is part of the fun for me, I think being
                too deterministic about design or even purpose can get in the way of exploration and
                play leads to new ideas and approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I started this website on a whim as a free
                <a href="https://neocities.org">NeoCities</a> account. I liked NeoCities so much I
                became a supporter for $5/month because that gives you including the ability to use
                a custom domain and much more storage space. This isn’t sponsored by NeoCities, I
                just genuinely think it’s a great service. Anyway, I set up my own domain and linked
                it to my NeoCities account then kept working on the site. From the start, I intended
                to make it this website simple, accessible, and fast.
            </p>
            <h3>Writing Posts</h3>
            <p>
                Write out all of my posts using the popular format
                <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown</a> which you may be
                familiar with if you’ve ever used Discord or Reddit. It’s much faster than manually
                coding HTML and lets you focus on the writing aspect without having to fire up a
                word processor. I write out the posts using the
                <a href="https://zed.dev">Zed editor</a> because it’s very easy to use, looks great,
                and loads fast.
            </p>

                    A comparison of how the last paragraph’s text looks when written in Markdown
                    (first image) and then rendered in HTML (second image) when viewed in the
                    Sublime Text editor with the Marina color scheme. Note how much simpler to write
                    and read Markdown is. John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, said that
                    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
                        >the biggest inspiration for it’s formatting is a simple plain-text email</a
                    >.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                To convert my plain text markdown files into usable HTML, I use
                <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> which is a simple terminal-based program
                that converts document formats into other document formats. Pandoc has a ton of
                really useful features, and it’s probably one of my favorite utilities I’ve ever
                used. Once I have an HTML file, I copy/paste the HTML onto a blank webpage template
                I built for the website, and it’s good to go live after I check that everything
                rendered right.
            </p>
            <h3>Colors, Contrast, and Icons</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Edit</strong>: I have since changed the colors used here, see
                <a href="../../../about.html">About</a> for more up-to-date information.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried my best to balance visually pleasing/pleasant colors that were still
                accessible. I pulled the colors I used for the default dark theme from
                <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-default-schemes/tree/master"
                    >Chris Kempson’s base16 color schemes</a
                >, specifically one I really like called “ocean” which has good contrast and a cool
                background color. I defaulted to this theme because I personally prefer dark themes
                with light text. Next, I workshopped a few different light themes but decided to use
                <a href="https://github.com/vallyscode/cloud-vscode-theme/tree/main"
                    >Valerii Lysenko’s “cloud” color scheme designed for VS Code</a
                >
                because thought it looked nice with decent contrast and good colors. I tried
                implementing a theme switcher GUI but decided it would just be easier to detect
                whether the user has a preference based on the device they’re viewing utilizing the
                <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> CSS media feature (<a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"
                    >read about that here</a
                >).
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img
                    src="../../../img/2025/08/color-scheme-base16-ocean.jpg"
                    alt="A small section of code highlighted in the dark base 16 ocean color scheme. It is a color scheme with a dark gray/blue background and moderately pigmented, cooler colors with a fair amount of contrast."
                />
                <img
                    src="../../../img/2025/08/color-scheme-cloud.jpg"
                    alt="A small section of code highlighted in the light cloud color scheme. It is a color scheme with an off-white background and moderately pigmented, agreeable colors with a fair amount of contrast."
                />
                <figcaption>
                    Some small sections of code using the
                    <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-default-schemes/tree/master"
                        >base 16 ocean dark color scheme</a
                    >
                    and the
                    <a href="https://github.com/vallyscode/cloud-vscode-theme/tree/main"
                        >cloud light color scheme</a
                    >
                    supplied by their creators Chris Kempson and Valerii Lysenko respectively. They
                    both utilize what, in my opinion, is a very pleasant, inviting color palette
                    with enough contrast that they are usable without being grating to look at.

            <p>
                I decided to use the
                <a href="https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce/tree/master"
                    >“elementary-xfce” icons by The Shimmer Project</a
                >
                which was a personal favorite SVG icon set utilized by my standby Linux distro
                <a href="https://xubuntu.org/">xubuntu</a>. I modified the colors of the files to
                correspond with the webpage text colors and made CSS change the icons set based on
                whether the user had a preference for light or dark mode. The CSS ID selectors of
                <code>#nav-home-icon</code>, <code>#nav-posts-icon</code>, and
                <code>#nav-about-icon</code> are used to target the
                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements in the navigation bar. My reasoning for using this
                icon theme was basically just that I liked how it used SVG files that wouldn’t
                pixelate and I liked the simplicity in their design. I’ve long been a big fan of the
                <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> and have inspired by its design
                and brand.

                    got interested in design.

                Next, I modified the color values to comply strictly with high contrast
                accessibility standards and made a new set of themes to be separately used if the
                user has the <code>prefers-contrast</code> CSS media feature; if the user had the
                value set to <code>more</code> on loading the page, it called the high contrast
                variant of the theme, but if the user’s value was set to <code>less</code>,
                <code>no-preference</code>, or <code>custom</code> (which indicates forced colors by
                the device), then it would either give the default color scheme or allow the forced
                colors to be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                I initially used a lot of JavaScript when trying to sort out the
                colors/contrast/icons, but I didn’t like the delay that caused in the site
                rendering, so I shifted towards utilizing as much CSS as I could by default and only
                leaning into JavaScript when I needed to. In the end. I used the fact that you can
                define variables in CSS and call them to create a template of background colors,
                text colors, and assorted other colors for colorful text like links or code blocks.
                For this code snippet, I’ve filled in the background of the hex value with the color
                it renders as so you can get an idea of the color palette. If you want to look at
                the CSS I currently have active,

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>
                First, I want to point out that there’s a difference between typography and
                lettering.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">Wikipedia defines typography</a>
                as “the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible,
                readable and appealing when displayed” which is
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettering">distinct from lettering</a>, or
                the “act or result of artfully drawing letters, instead of writing them simply.”
                Basically, trying to make a web page or a document look good and be legible is
                dealing in typography and using a paintbrush to expressively write out words on a
                poster is lettering. My interest in typography was kicked off by reading the free
                online book
                <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Butterick’s Practical Typography</a>, it
                greatly increased my appreciation for typography and typeface/font design and
                influenced my general design decisions for documents and webpages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I want to note the distinction between typefaces and fonts.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface">Wikipedia defines a typeface</a>
                as “a design of letters, numbers and other symbols, to be used in printing or for
                electronic display,” and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font">defines a font</a> as “a particular
                size, weight and style of a typeface.” So, in example, if you’re talking about
                Helvetica then you’re referring to a typeface but if you’re talking about Helvetica
                bold, Helvetica italic, or Helvetica light, then you’re referring to a font of the
                Helvetica typeface. Also, maybe I’m showing my design nerd side a bit here but did
                you know there’s
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/helvetica-2007"
                    >a documentary about Helvetica</a
                >
                that’s actually pretty interesting?
            </p>
            <p>
                Making sure we understand the distinctions between typography/lettering and
                typefaces/fonts isn’t just being pedantic, the distinction is significant for this
                section, and it kinda bugs me when people use them interchangeably.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, with that out of the way, I wanted to go for a typefaces that are more
                accessible/dyslexia-friendly which also fit with the visual direction of the site.
                After doing some research, I surveyed some common options people used/recommended
                and decided on going with
                <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-sans">Source Sans 3</a>
                (formerly known as Source Sans Pro) for body text because it’s quite comparable to
                popular sans-serif accessible fonts like Tahoma, Verdana, and Calibri but free to
                download use online. I elected to use this for body text because sans-serif fonts
                are generally seen as more accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                For headings, I wanted a serif typeface to contrast with the body text that was
                comparable to the accessible Times New Roman (also I don’t really like Times New
                Roman). After deliberating a bit, I decided to go with
                <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif-4">Source Serif 4</a>
                (formerly known as Source Serif Pro) because it pairs well with its sibling Source
                Sans 3 and is also free to download and use online. The specific font I used for
                headings is the semi-bold version with a weight of 600 (for context, “regular” type
                is usually 400 and “bold” is usually 700) because I liked how it didn’t feel too
                heavy but still stuck out.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn’t a blog for programming specifically, although it is a hobby of mine, so I
                wanted to make sure to also include a monospace typeface for displaying any code I
                may reference. I cycled between a few options but landed on a variant of
                <a href="https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>
                called
                <a href="https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC">Inconsolata LGC</a>
                which adds italic and bold fonts to the original version, has better line and
                character spacing, has support for Cyrillic and Greek, and generally renders better
                on Windows in my experience (the font rendering on Windows is really abysmal in my
                opinion). Inconsolata LGC also has many similar
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterform">letterforms</a>
                compared to Source Sans 3 and Source Serif 4 and is a generally all-around great
                looking typeface.

                I tested using the popular web font service Google Fonts for bring my specific
                typeface preferences to the website, but it slowed down the loading time too much.
                Also, I don’t want to subject people who view the site to Google’s analytics or
                potentially have the font files change or be unavailable if Google modified or
                deleted the files they use. I considered just using common operating system fonts,
                but I didn’t really like how they looked and wanted it to be consistent across
                platforms. So I tested just loading the fonts onto the web server and calling them
                using the
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face"
                    >CSS <code>@font-face</code> rule</a
                >, and it actually loaded quite fast so it seemed like the way to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the maximum width of this blog to be 36 rem (or about 576 pixels if you’re
                using the default 16 pixel font size) so that the average line length doesn’t exceed
                90 characters,
                <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html"
                    >the upward limit for comfortable reading</a
                >. If your line length is too long, your eyes have to travel too far to find the
                start of the next line, and it’s more visually tiring. I set the default line
                spacing to be 1.45 (1 is single-spaced and 2 is double-spaced) for the sake of
                increased legibility and comfort. I also primarily use rem instead of pixels, em,
                percentages, or the other stuff out there
                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-units-when-to-use-each-one/"
                    >because it scales well based on the user’s text size preference</a
                >
                which makes it more accessible if a user prefers larger text.
