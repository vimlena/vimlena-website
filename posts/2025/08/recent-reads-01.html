    <h1>Recent Reads 01</h1>
    <address rel="author">Vim Lena</address>
    <time datetime="2025-08-06">August 6, 2025</time>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      What are “recent reads”? Well, my idea with this hopefully re-occuring post format is to periodically share links
      and initial thoughts I have about things I’ve found in online that I think are insightful, provocative, or
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may share a quick blurb next to the links with any initial thoughts I have but the focus is on linking to other
      stuff I find on the internet. I am focusing on text-based articles although I may also link other things like
      YouTube videos or images/image galleries if they stick out to me, the content will vary based on what I’m learning
      about or what internet wormholes I’ve fallen down. The content of the links will vary in length but I’ll include
      an indicator of, say, how long a video is or an estimation of how long an article will take to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do this? Simply, there are a lot of people in this world who have different experiences, perspectives, ideas,
      and approaches than you or I do which are worth our attention and consideration. Rather than try and summarize or
      quote everything, it makes more sense to just link to stuff so that the authors/creators can speak for themselves.
      It’s cool that the internet lets us have near-instant access to such a vast amount of information and media,
      something actually really novel and new in human history but overlooked among many who have grown used to it.

    <h2>“Understanding Transmisogyny” and “Understanding Lesbophobia” Series</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding Transmisogyny
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://taliabhattwrites.substack.com/p/understanding-transmisogyny-part">Part One: Misogyny and

      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding Lesbophobia
        <ul>

              ex Machina”</a> by Talia Bhatt (article, Substack, 01/19/2024, 26–33 min)</li>

            18–23 min)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Bhatt’s writing throughout all of these is <em>really</em> exceptional and I think the points she makes are well-
      reasoned and argued while still being approachable. She captures a fire in her writing that I think is missing
      from a lot of contemporary feminist thought. I was made aware of Bhatt’s writing while on Bluesky and I’m really
      glad I took the time to read it. Going to buy her books “Trans / Rad / Fem” and “Brown / Trans / Les” when I have
      funds. Definitely <a href="https://taliabhatt.com/">check out her website</a> for more of her writing and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/taliabhatt.itch.io">follow her on Bluesky</a> if you’re a user on that platform!
    </p>
    <h2>Trans Liberalism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/reject-transgender-liberalism-gill-peterson">“Reject Transgender
          Liberalism”</a> by Jules Gill-Peterson (article, The Baffler, 07/21/2025, 17–21 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So I <a href="./trans-liberalism-and-medical-transition.html">wrote a whole long post both criticizing and
        supporting different parts of this essay</a> because I admire Gill-Peterson’s work and have found it to be
      well-worth engaging with. Her books “A Short History of Trans Misogyny” and “Histories of the Transgender Child”
      are worth taking the time to read, although two of the links below also criticize the former so I think those are
      good supplementary commentary.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/2245-the-limits-of-trans-liberalism-by-nat-raha">“The Limits of
          Transgender Liberalism”</a> by Nat Raha (article, Verso Books Blog, 09/21/2015, 9–11 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Reha’s article is important reminder that the state will not liberate us and even if things appear to be
      “improving” for trans people. Remember that this was first published around the time the “Tipping Point” for
      acceptance was declared. We should always be looking at whether the material conditions are improving for those
      who are most affected by oppression when assessing the state of things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trans-rights-biological-sex-gender-judith-butler.html">“Why
          Trans Kids Have the Right to Change Their Biological Sex”</a> by Andrea Long Chu (article, New York Magazine,
        03/11/2024, 57–72 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Best analysis and response to the contemporary moral panic over trans youth seeking medical care I have read. The
      idea proposed here of a right to change sex is so immensely valuable and important.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoZFZto6Wqg">“Millions of Dead Genders: A MOGAI Retrospective”</a> by
        Lily Alexandre (video, YouTube, 01/11/2021, 37 min)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOmffiWss0">“That Time Tumblr Invented Its Own Genders”</a> by
        Strange Æons (video, YouTube, 06/02/2023, 31 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Two pretty good video essays about the phenomenon of MOGAI Tumblr. I think that they kinda lose the plot in
      talking about this as a “radical” phenomenon or asserting that all of this stuff is “valid” but it was good to get
      my wheels turning in critically analyzing this subject.
    </p>
    <h2>Trans Orientialism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://c4ss.org/content/59643">“An Orientalist History of Transmisogyny”</a> by Julianna Neuhouser
        (article, Center for a Stateless Society, 05/27/2024, 10–13 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A good criticism of Jules Gill-Peterson’s exploration of travesti identity and politics in the final chapter of
      her book “A Short History of Trans Misogyny” where she basically gives the example of Latin-American transfeminism
      as a path forward. Basically, Neuhouser argues that the subject more complicated and nuances than Gill-Peterson
      simplifies it to be and points out that there are other historically transfeminized colonial subjects that precede
      British-occupied India’s policies about hijras.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://substack.com/@taliabhatt/p-148363142">“The Third Sex”</a> by Talia Bhatt (article, Substack,
        09/01/2024, 63–80 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Invaluable and thorough exploration of the orientialist, transphobic gaze of western anthropology towards hijras
      and other cultures where they academically suppose the existence of a “third sex.” Honestly this article made me
      re-think a lot of my assumptions and ideas about this subject because of largely being informed by the legacy of
      Serena Nanda and Gayatri Reddy’s orientialist works.
    </p>
    <h2>Trans and Queer History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_Aqmaq_a2U">“In The Life Episode 602: Interview with Kate Bornstein,
          Leslie Feinberg”</a> by UCLA Library Film and Television Archive (video, YouTube, 10/21/1996, 58 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A pretty cool interview with two of the original popular trans activists and theorists with some historical
      insight into the early movement. I like how you can tell how much they appreciate each other’s company and had fun
      recording this (Bornstein even jokingly refers to Feinberg as “Daddy” at one point).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://the-rambling.com/2019/11/26/issue6-gill-peterson/">“On Wanting Trans Women and Children (For
          Better or For Worse)”</a> by Jules Gill-Peterson (article, The Rambling, 11/26/2019, 16–20 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This article is Gill-Peterson’s reflections on her then recently published book “Histories of the Transgender
      Child.” At the end of it, she talks about the sense of shame she feels for the fact that just writing and thinking
      about trans youth’s history isn’t enough to save them which is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately in
      light of recent events.
    </p>
    <h2>Misc</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://taliabhattwrites.substack.com/p/racebending-and-womanface-discussing">“‘Racebending’ and
          ‘Womanface’: Discussing Social Constructs”</a> by Talia Bhatt (article, Substack, 12/16/2023, 13–17 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A good discussion on why race and gender can’t simply be swapped out because they’re both social constructs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/why-does-transvestigation-happen-d2c19847afb9">“Why Does
          ‘Transvestigation’ Happen?”</a> by Julia Serano (article, Medium, 08/27/2024, 38–48 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From one of the originators of transfeminism, this is Serano’s thoughts on the phenomenon of investigating whether
      people are trans, both enacted towards celebrities by conspiracy theorists as well as an everyday cognitive social
      phenomenon. Well-worded and insightful.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://thetransdandy.substack.com/p/trans-male-privilege">“Trans Male Privilege”</a> by The Trans
        Dandy (article, Substack, 06/16/2025, 59–74 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Probably the best article I’ve ever read about transmasculine issues and identity. Huge, huge rec.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://translegislation.com/">Trans Legislation Tracker</a> by Trans Legislation Tracker (website,
        self-published by independent research organization, 2022-current, ? min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A website documenting proposed and passed anti-trans legislation. It includes a map where you can look at what’s
      happening in your specific state. Really shocking how anti-trans legislation has exponentially risen since 2015.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://transreads.org/">Trans Reads</a> by Trans Reads (website, self-published, 2019–current, ?
        min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A website where you can download a bunch of cool various trans texts for free.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVVxAZYLUyc">“citrus and the rise of yuri/gl anime and manga”</a> by
        n6lr0 (video, YouTube, 01/10/2024, 2 hrs 28 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A really long but very valuable discussion of the anime Citrus with a lot of time spent talking about it’s place
      in the historical context of Class S and Yuri.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn9SzsM7FGM">“The Horrors of Overnight TV”</a> by Farrell McGuire
        (video, YouTube, 07/10/2025, 58 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cool video talking about the phenomenon of weird late night TV in the USA, specifically public access and
      advertisements. I really like McGuire’s videos about different regional variations and time periods of horror on
      the internet also.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.removepaywall.com/">Remove Paywall</a> by ? (website, self-published, 2022–present, ?
        min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now that my usual preferred way to get around paywalls online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709209/news-media-alliance-12ft-io-takedown-paywall">was taken down</a> (RIP
      12ft.io), this is a site I’ve found that more or less does the same thing. Kinda hate that something like this has
      to exist but yeah. All my homies hate garden walls.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking Website</a> by Barry T. Smith (website,
        self-published, 2013, ~3 min)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When I got into learning webpage design and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, there was a lot of emphasis on like flashy
      effects and complicated frameworks that used up a bunch of memory and slowed load time a lot. I don’t remember
      when I first found this (admittedly kinda cringe) website but I do think it makes a point: websites are kinda too
      complex now in their attempt to be everything. Maybe we should remember that websites work by default and we break
      them by adding a bunch of stuff to them. When I made this blog, I intentionally opted to just use basic HTML and
      CSS without bringing up a bunch of images or complex frameworks because I wanted it to <em>just work</em> and be
      accessible without having to be hosted on a walled garden website. So yeah it’s very 2013 in the best way but it
      reminded me of the an oft-repeated maxim of software development: keep it simple, stupid.
