            <h1>Some Actually Good Free Fonts</h1>
            <address rel="author">Vim Lena</address>

            <h2>Why Not Just Use [System Font]?</h2>
            <p>In Matthew Butterick’s excellent and free-to-read book <a href="(https://practicaltypography.com/)">“Butterick’s Practical Typography,”</a> he outlines three main reasons to <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html">avoid using the system fonts</a> that come standard with your operating system:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Many system fonts aren’t good.</em> The Windows and Mac OS libraries have improved, but they’re still minefields of awful fonts. I won’t name names, but my least favorite rhymes with Barial.</li>
                    <li><em>Many system fonts have been optimized for the screen, not print.</em> This comes at the cost of design details, which have been sanded off because they don’t reproduce well on screen (e.g., Georgia,
                    Verdana, Cambria, and Calibri). Screen-optimized fonts look clunky on the printed page.</li>
                    <li><em>All system fonts are overexposed.</em> Because these fonts are included with billions of computers, they’re used all the time. Not every typography project demands novelty. But if yours does, look elsewhere. For instance, please don’t adopt the slogan “A Design Firm Unlike Any Other” and then set it in Helvetica.</li>
                </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In the book, he shares some of his <a href="(https://practicaltypography.com/free-fonts.html)">favorite fonts that are free to use and distribute</a> which are released under licenses like the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/documents/OFL.txt">SIL Open Font License</a> (<a href="https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/open-font-license-ofl-explained">summary</a>) or similarly permissive licenses but he acknowledges that, ultimately, the baseline for professionally created, paid typefaces/fonts is generally higher and that they’re essential tools for those who should care about typography like designers or writers. That being said, I still think there’s some great options out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you look up “free fonts” with a search engine, much of what you will find on any generic free font website online is pretty bad, both as in badly designed/ugly and also just not very functional.

                As somebody who has been into typography and design as a hobby now for a while, I thought I would share some of my reccomendations so you don’t have to sift through a bunch of websites full of ninja fonts when you just want something that looks good. I’m not a professional by any means so this isn’t any sort of a definitive or authoratative list of any kind, just some suggestions to check out and maybe download to have on deck when you’re working on documents or design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m going to divide this list up based on different common classifications usable of typefaces: Sans-serif, Serif, and Monospace. Sans-serif typefaces exclude the serifs at the end of the strokes in the character and are usually seen as being more simple, modern, and clean (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a>). Serif typefaces include the serifs at the end of strokes and are usually seen as authoritative and professional (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman">Times New Roman</a>). Monospace typefaces make all the characters occupy the same amount of space (hence the name) and were designed for typewriters initially, they are usually seen as retro, technical, and minimalist (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)">Courier New</a>). I’ll also list a few typeface families that include sans-serif, serif, and monospace at the end.

                The most common formats of font files are TrueType Font (<code>.ttf</code>) and OpenType Font (<code>.otf</code>), both work on different operating systems just fine but OpenType is technically a more advanced iteration of TrueType so that would usually be the reccomendation for installing in your system. There are other formats like <code>.woff</code>, <code>.woff2</code>, and <code>.svg</code> (<a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/different-font-file-types-explained-ott-ttf-woff--cms-39047">comparison between formats here</a>) but for most cases TrueType or OpenType will get the job done.

            <h2>Sans-serif</h2>
            <h3>Open Sans</h3>
            <p>
                Open sans is a typeface commissioned by Google and designed by Steve Matteson at Ascender Fonts. It’s a humanist sans-serif that reads as open and friendly with a nice variety of weights and a condensed variant. It looks great on interfaces, on the web, and in print provided it has some room to breathe.

            <h3>Lato</h3>
            <p>
                Lato means “summer” in Polish. The humanist typeface was designed by Łukasz Dziedzic with help from his friend Adam Twardoch. It was intended for a corporate client who opted to choose another typeface instead so it was released publicly for free instead. It’s a transparent, versitile typeface, both for headings and body text in print and online.

            <h3>Inter</h3>
            <p>
                Inter is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Rasmus Andersson for easily reading on screen at various sizes. It was designed as an improvement on Google’s default sans-serif font for Android and it’s internet platforms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto">Roboto</a>. While designed for and widely used in interfaces primarily, it also looks pretty decent in print because it has a lot of DNA from other neo-grotesque sans-serif typefaces Helvetica.

            <h3>Monsterrat</h3>
            <p>
                Monsterrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by graphic designer Julieta Ulanovsky. It is inspired by vintage 1930s–1950s posters and signage in the Montserrat neighbourhood of Buenos Aires where she was going to school and it’s development was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. It works best best for headings or titles displayed on screens or in print but could work for body text as well.

            <h2>Serif</h2>
            <h3>Linux Libertine</h3>
            <p>
                Linux Libertine is a transitional serif typeface designed by Philipp H. Poll as an alternative to popular serif fonts with proprietary licenses like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman">Times New Roman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino">Palatino</a>. It has very extensive unicode coverage allowing it to be used across languages easily and looks great in print and is a personal favorite of mine.

            <p>
                Crimson Text is an old style serif typeface designed by Sebastian Kosch for print. It’s inspired by elegant 19th century serif typography and has really lovely little intricacies that make headings and body text pop while still being very legible.

            <p>
                Lora is a transitional serif typeface designed by the Cyreal type foundry. While optimized for screens, it also works well for printed materials as well. It resembles a better version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman">Times New Roman</a> and is extremely easy to read.

            <h2>Monospace</h2>
            <h3>Inconsolata LGC</h3>
            <p>
                Inconsolata is a humanist sans-serif monospace typeface designed by Raph Levien for looking better on high resolution screens and in print than typefaces designed for programmers typically do. While most monospace typefaces are basically adaptations of non-monospace typefaces, Inconsolata is intentionally designed as a monospace font. Levien was inspired by Luc(as) de Groot’s design of <a href="https://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/the-sans-mono">TheSansMono</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas">Consolas</a> which proved to Levien that “monospaced fonts do not have to suck.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Inconsolata was <a href="https://blog.cosmix.org/2011/01/06/inconsolata-hellenic/">copied and modified (forked) by Dimosthenis Kaponis</a> to add support for Greek language characters and renamed Inconsolata Hellenic. Following this, Inconsolata Hellenic was <a href="https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC">forked by GitHub user MihailJP</a> to add support for Cyrillic characters and renamed Inconsolata LGC.
            </p>
            <p>
                I reccomend Inconsolata LGC instead of Inconsolata because of the larger language support and also the fact that it renders the better on Windows operating systems. It is a very legible, clean, functional design and is my personal favorite for working with code. <code>It is also what I elected to choose for the monospace code typeface on this site.</code>

            <h3>Meslo LG</h3>
            <p>
                Meslo LG is a humanist monospace typeface designed by André Berg, it is a modified version of the default monospace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)">Menlo</a> typeface in macOS from 2009–2015 (which is itself based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera">Bitstream Vera Mono</a>). Berg added options for more vertical line spacing (small, medium, and large), moved the asterisk to be located higher on the line, and added options for a dotted zero instead of the default slashed zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meslo LG was my preferred choice for working with code (specifically the medium spacing version with the slashed zero) before I started using Inconsolata LGC for everything. It’s an overall very functional and good-looking improvement on Menlo and Bitstream Vera Mono.

It is designed from the ground up to let programmers see more text on screen and reduce difficulty in distinguishing characters through a narrow width and distincive letterforms.

            <h3>Iosevka</h3>
            <p>
                Iosevka is a monospace font designed by Belleve Invis that supports extensive customization of common character renderings, a slab serif variant, and extensive language support. It is narrow compared to typical monospacetypefaces which allows more code to fit on-screen at once for programmers.

            <h2>Full Typeface Families</h2>
            <h3>Source</h3>
            <p>
                The Source family consists of six typefaces: Source Sans 3 by Paul D. Hunt, Source Serif 4 by Frank Grießhammer, Source Code Pro by Paul D. Hunt, Source Han Sans by Ryoko Nishizuka, Source Han Serif by Ryoko Nishizuka and Frank Grießhammer, and Source Han Code by Ryoko Nishizuka and Paul D. Hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Source Sans 3 (formerly known as Source Sans Pro) is a grotesque humanist sans-serif typeface inspired by gothic typefaces designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton">Morris Fullerton Benton</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Gothic">Franklin Gothic</a>. It works well on-screen or in print as a heading or as body text, has fairly extensive language support, and has seven weights (regular, extra-light, light, medium, semibold, bold, and black) for a variety of options in fine-tuning what looks best. I decided to use Source Sans 3 as the typeface for body text on this website (you’re reading it right now) because I found it to be accessible, legible, appealing, and neutral but somehow still with character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Source Serif 4 (formerly known as Source Serif Pro) is a transitional typeface inspired by the work of 18th century French typographer Pierre Simon Fournier whose influence we can see in transitional serif typefaces such as <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/ps-fournier">PS Fournier</a>. It has six weights (regular, extra-light, light, semibold, bold, and black), caption, display, and small text variants, and extensive language support. It looks rich, sturdy, and distinct both on-screen and in print. Because of being in the same family, it pairs well with Source Sans 3 and I am generally a big fan of it so I elected to use it for headings on this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Source Code Pro is a monospace typeface that takes design cues from Source Sans 3. Another personal favorite, I appreciate how it’s letterforms are distinct and legible. When designing it, Paul D. Hunt made sure to find the right balance of space between the height and space of lowercase letters compared to uppercase letters while not being too elaborate to distract a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not speak Mandarin (unfortunately) and cannot accurately judge the quality of the Source Han Sans/Serif/Mono typefaces but, from what I gather, they are generally regarded as good.

            <h3>Computer Modern</h3>
            <p>
                Computer Modern is a typeface family designed by Donald Knuth consisting of CMU Sans Serif, CMU Serif, CMU Typewriter Text (monospace), CMU Bright (a sans-serif variant), and CMU concrete (a slab serif variant). It was designed to work with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">T<sub>E</sub>X typesetting program</a> which Knuth also created and is extensively utilized in academic publishing for complex typesetting tasks like math formulas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knuth jokes on the project homepage that the typeface family is “so good-looking that some scientists do research just so they can write it up in Computer Modern” and I would have to agree. There’s an elegance to all of the typefaces that is very reminescent of the sort of type you would see in an old well-made academic journal set with old school metal tools. Even if you don’t use T<sub>E</sub>X or (or L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X or ConT<sub>E</sub>Xt), these are really beautiful and functional typefaces to utilize when making documents that you really can’t go wrong with.

            <h3>DejaVu</h3>
            <p>
                The DejaVu typeface family is designed by a <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Authors.html">group of authors working collaboratively</a> and consists of the following typefaces: DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Mono. It is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera">Bitstream Vera</a> family but with dramatically expanded support for languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the typefaces that make up this library aren’t necessarily anything particularly special, they are generally pretty okay and have really excellent language and character support so they make great fallbacks if you’re ever having trouble rendering characters.

            <h3>IBM Plex</h3>
            <p>
                IBM Plex is a typeface family by Mike Abbink, Paul van der Laan, and Pieter van Rosmalen commissionied by IBM to replace Helvetica (which it had used for over 50 years previously). It consists of IBM Plex Sans (with a Condensed variant), IBM Plex Serif, and IBM Plex Mono.
            </p>
            <p>
                IBM Plex Sans is a grotesque sans-serif typeface designed to not look soft, inefficient, or overly perfected. It is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Gothic">Franklin Gothic</a> and has an approachable, neutral tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                IBM Plex Serif is a transitional serif typeface inspired by didone typefaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni">Bodoni</a> and old style typefaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janson">Janson</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                IBM Plex Mono is a monospace font inspired by the default typeface used on the IBM Selectric electric typewriter and is a generally well-regarded programming font with distinct letterforms and a narrow width to fit more code on-screen.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            I hope these were helpful suggestions for actually decent and useful free fonts to use for basically whatever you want! If nothing else, they’re good to keep around if you want alternatives for common system fonts that look better in print and aren’t as common.
