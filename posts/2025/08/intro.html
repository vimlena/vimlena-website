      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <address rel="author">Vim Lena</address>

      <h2>Anthophorism?</h2>
      <p>
        I’m calling this blog “Anthophorism,” which is a word I created. If we
        break it down into it’s roots, we find that “antho” means flower, “phor”
        means bearer or producer of, and “ism” means a doctrine, cause, theory,
        act, or practice. So this word could be read “the theory of bearing
        flowers” or “the practice of producing flowers.”
      </p>
      <p>Why am I concerned with flowers? My answer is threefold:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A
          <a href="https://www.almanac.com/flower-meanings-language-flowers"
            >quick search about the cultural significance of flowers</a
          >
          will reveal that they are highly symbolic for basically every
          emotional or sentimental aspect of life you could think of. They are
          also usually given or received at times of notable achievement or a
          memorable event.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flowers are picked and cherished for their temporary beauty before
          they inevitably decompose or dry out, something that runs parallel to
          all life which is fleeting but worth appreciating while it’s here.
          People can extend the liveliness of flowers, but they will always fade
          having been cut off from their roots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flowers, despite these two previous points, are ultimately just
          reproductive organs of many varieties of plants. A long-standing
          interest of mine which I’ll probably talk about a lot here is
          sexuality and gender, which are tied to reproduction or a lack thereof
          in interesting ways so it feels fitting.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If we put all of these ideas together, we understand Anthophorism to be
        the theory or practice of producing or bearing meaning/significance,
        temporariness/mortality, and gender/sexuality.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I go by Vim Lena, I use they and she pronouns, and I’m a bi transfem
        transsexual. I’m politically inclined towards Marxism and identify with
        transfeminism. I’m averse sharing too much about myself online and the
        way that people sorta delimit whatever you have to say by your labels or
        identity, so I will aim to just let my thoughts and online presence
        speak for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like film and watch a lot of science fiction, thrillers, horror, and
        otherwise subversive stuff, and I’m also interested in books, TV shows,
        music, etc. that are about such topics as well (I especially enjoy Star
        Trek). I’ve been a musician for most of my life and if I ever publish
        any of my music I’ll probably make a post about it. I’m not super
        academic, but I spend a lot of time reading about stuff online because I
        love learning and thinking critically about the world. I’m definitely
        more of a cat person, I have two pet cats who are brothers from the same
        litter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I basically made this blog so that I could post long-form thoughts on
        what I’m reading, watching, listening to, and engaging with because I am
        not a very short-winded or succinct person in general and have a
        preference for expression through text over audio/visual media. I also
        made this blog because I thought it would be a fun project and would
        give me a bit of space from social media which seems to be everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will not stick to a strict posting schedule, my posts will probably
        not be consistently long or short, some of them will be more serious and
        others less so, and the subjects I talk about will vary based on what I
        want to say. If you want to get in contact with me to discuss ideas or
        questions you have about what I say here, my homepage should have
        up-to-date links to my social media.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
