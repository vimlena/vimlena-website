                Four days ago, I released
                <a href="https://github.com/vimlena/consolena/releases/tag/v1.0.0"
                    >Consolena v 1.0.0</a
                >. This is something I have been working on slowly for quite a while to get it
                correct before it’s shipped and I’m happy to properly share it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consolena is a monospace typeface with a focus on legibility and consistency. They
                each come in regular-width and condensed-width versions that also come with or
                without ligatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looks best at a slightly larger minimum size than most people seem to typically use;
                in my tests, about 12.5–13.5 pt depending on the platform/app. Many screens are very
                high resolution these days so you can still see a lot without straining your eyes.
                You can make your text slightly larger, I believe in you.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consolena → Regular width, no ligatures</li>
                <li>ConsolenaC → Condensed width, no ligatures</li>
                <li>ConsolenaL → Regular width, includes ligatures</li>
                <li>ConsolenaLC → Condensed width, includes ligatures</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Consolena is based on
                <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/">Iosevka 33.3.6</a> by Belleve Invis,
                specifically the SS04 DejaVu Sans Mono/Meslo stylistic set with term spacing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consolena was created using the
                <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer">Iosevka Customizer Tool</a> then
                tweaking the parameters/build plans file with some minor additional tweaks using the
                <a href="https://glyphsapp.com">Glyphs app</a> (which I highly recommend for type
                design).
            </p>
            <p>
                A huge benefit of being based on Iosevka is that Consolena has support for Cyrillic
                and Greek characters. I do not speak Greek or any language that used these character
                sets, but the defaults for Iosevka SS04 are very sane so that’s nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not everybody likes ligatures, which is why I made versions that do not have as well
                as versions that include ligatures. For versions that support ligatures, I include
                most common ligatures except for <code>!=</code> → ≠ because I personally find that
                to be visually a bit disorienting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My thoughts with regards to the specific letterforms I chose was to create something
                that I actually wanted to use. It looks nice and all the commonly used characters
                are distinct but it is still coherently styled. Meslo/ Menlo/ DejaVu Sans Mono are
                really iconic and well-loved coding typefaces which influenced my decision to use it
                as inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted the letterforms to look similar in italics and roman versions, but for it
                to have elegant and distinctive italics. The italic slant is 9° which is slightly
                less severe than many italics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The zero is not quite slashed or dotted, it’s basically a hybrid between the two. I
                like the distinctiveness of a dotted zero, but not how it looks. I like the look of
                a slashed zero, but don’t like how it can be confused with the empty set character
                (∅) or the slashed zero character (Ø or ø) common in some languages.
