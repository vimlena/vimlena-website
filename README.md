# Vim Lena Website

This is the code currently live on [vimlena.com](https://vimlena.com).

[This is the introductory post](https://vimlena.com/posts/2025/08/intro) for the blog and [this is a post talking about how/why I made it like I did](https://vimlena.com/posts/2025/08/making-a-blog-in-2025).

Feel free to look through the code in this repo and use it so long as you abide by the terms of the licenses I use.

The icons I use are from The Shimmer Project’s [elementary-xfce](https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce/tree/master) icon theme (also GNU GPL v3), specifically the ‘symbolic’ folders, and are modified to fit with the website color scheme and resized to be slighly larger.
